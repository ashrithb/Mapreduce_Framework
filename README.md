# Mapreduce_Framework
The framework executes MapReduce programs with distributed processing on a cluster of computers. This project includes MapReduce program execution, basic distributed systems, fault tolerance, OS-provided concurrency facilities (threads and processes), and networking (sockets). This was inspired by [Googleâ€™s original MapReduce paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf), and all of this is built in Python!!

This project consists of two major pieces of code. A manager that listens for user-submitted MapReduce jobs and distributes the work among Workers. Multiple Worker instances receive instructions from the Manager and execute map and reduce tasks that combine to form a MapReduce program. Here is a basic rundown of what my program looks like:
